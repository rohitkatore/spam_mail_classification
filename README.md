Spam-mail-classification
This project implements a Spam Email Classification system using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The system classifies emails as either spam or ham (non-spam) based on the content of the emails. The project uses TF-IDF vectorizer for feature extraction, and the trained model is saved using Pickle for future use. A Streamlit app is included for easy interaction with the model.

Features
Spam Detection: Classifies emails as spam or ham using a Naive Bayes classifier.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text data into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method.
Model Persistence: The trained model is saved using Pickle, so it doesn't need to be retrained each time.
Streamlit App: A user-friendly web interface to test the classifier in real-time.
